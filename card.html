			<p> White tigers are a rare color variation of Bengal tigers, 
				distinguished by their striking white fur with black or dark
				brown stripes and icy blue eyes. This unique appearance is the 
				result of a recessive gene mutation, and most white tigers 
				found today are bred in captivity.
